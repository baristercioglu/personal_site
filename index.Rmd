I am an Economics PhD candidate at the New School for Social Research. My research interests lie in economic growth, inequality, and secular stagnation. In particular, I am interested in the slowdown of output and productivity growth in the US economy after 1980 and its political economy implications including wage stagnation and chronic demand problems. In my research, I benefit from heterodox approaches and Bayesian statistics.  


I am very fortunate to receive my economics training from an institution which values diversity highly. The diverse community of the New School (and the New York City), who come from different countries and various socioeconomic backgrounds, shaped my academic character and interactions with people. The New School has provided me with a unique political economy perspective, which I use with the critical macroeconomic theory to understand the current questions of our economies.
