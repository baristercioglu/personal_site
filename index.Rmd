I am an Economics PhD candidate at the New School for Social Research. My research interests lie in economic growth, inequality, and secular stagnation. In particular, I am interested in the slowdown of output and productivity growth in the US economy after 1980 and its political economy implications including wage stagnation and chronic demand problems. In my research, I benefit from heterodox approaches and Bayesian statistics.
