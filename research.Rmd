My dissertation consists of three essays on measurement of US growth, inequality, and output gap from a sectoral perspective. In my first essay, I argue that rapidly growing financial, healthcare, and professional-business services are a means to the end of economic welfare, and, therefore, they are better treated as intermediate consumption of households. I adjust real output growth by using the Input-Output data of the Bureau of Economic Analysis over 1947-2017, and find a deeper slowdown of growth post-1973 than the conventional GDP. My second essay estimates the impact of adjustments on income distribution from 1985 to 2015. By using consumer expenditure survey data of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, I estimate that labor income finances more than 90\% of the US household expenditures on finance, healthcare and professional-business services. I find a sharper rise in inequality post-1985 as the adjusted labor share declines more than the conventional labor share over 1985-2015. In my final essay, I shift from sectoral sources of actual GDP to potential GDP, and estimate output gaps of 20 US industries over 1948-2019 by using value-added by industry data of the Bureau of Economic Analysis. I find a generally negative output gap at the aggregate except for the second half of the 1960s, and a persistent excess-capacity since 1990. I show that secular stagnation is not an inevitable feature of the US economy, and it can be avoided by eliminating the chronic output gap through demand supporting policies.
